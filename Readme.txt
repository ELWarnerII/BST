The input files for this project must be formatted according to
the given standards in the project documentation. An unformatted
text file will not perform the correct tasks.

Upon running the program, you will be welcomed and prompted
for an input file. Simply type in the filepath and file you wish
to process. If you enter an invalid file name you will be prompted
again until you enter a valid file name.

You will then be prompted for an output file. Again,
simply type in the filepath and file name you wish your output to
be stored in. If the file you specify already exists, you will be
asked to confirm or deny whether that file should be overwritten.

The program will then execute the tree build, insert operations,
and remove operations. It will give you a message when your output
file has successfully been generated.
